## Languages I'm happy to use in projects
- Rust
- C#
- Typescript

## Languages I don't mind using but try not to have to use
- Python
- Javascript
- C
- C++

## Languages I avoid like the plague
- Objective-C 
- Swift (usually)
- Kotlin
- Java

## Languages I'm mildly interested in trying
- Go
- V
- Sonic Pi (if you can consider that a language)
- Elixir
- Lua (but the 1-indexed lists confuse me)

## Languages I'm too stupid to use effectively but want to get good at
- Assembly
- Haskell
- Brainfuck (hello world will be enough for me in this case)
- Elm

---

This only applies to this snapshot of time, a sort of time-capsule for future me to look back upon and think fondly, 
"ah, the good old days when I dreamt of assembly and didn't have to use Java."

## Also, some projects I want to do at some point
- Toy compiler for an esolang that no one knows exists except my one friend who programs exclusively in it

- An OS that does nothing but print `hello world` but *definitely* has an extensive C api that would let me extend it to a MacOS competitor the second I sit down and write some more code

- A raytracing engine that's 3x slower than any of the other ones available, but I use it exclusively because I'm adamant that my trigonometry is innovative and *after a few more rounds of Moore's law it'll be the fastest one around*

- Some sort of DALLE-2 type AI but for music

- A blog with an actual pulse

- Something I haven't thought of yet, but it'll change the world somehow
